# Instaplaces

## About ##
[Instaplaces](http://instaplac.es) is a tool for finding interesting places around you using pictures taken on Instagram.

Using the Instagram API and the user's location (GPS or IP-based), Instaplaces presents pictures taken nearby - grouped by 
the place where the picture was taken, and ordered by the amount of pictures taken.
